- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cesar-Paredes

- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything and everything that would make me a better developer, programming is my pasion and even though it could be difficult from time to time, I find it very easy to put in the time in learning any technology.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in Java, PHP, Web services and also front end development, since my main long term goal is to be able to do full stack development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mainly on back-end and as an alternative I'm also open for front-end development
