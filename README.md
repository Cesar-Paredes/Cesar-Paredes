- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cesar-Paredes

- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything and everything that would make me a better developer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in Java, PHP, C# Web services, server-side programming and also front-end development, since my main long term goal is to be able to do full stack development.<br/>

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mainly on back-end and as an alternative I'm also open for front-end development
